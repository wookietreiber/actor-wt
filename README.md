Actor-based Widget Toolkit
==========================

This project represents an attempt to implement an [actor][actor-model]-based
[widget toolkit][widget-toolkit].

The first stage consists of writing a specification using the [Wiki][wiki]. If
the idea seems worth the effort an implementation, based on the specification,
using [Scala][scala] and [Akka][akka] will follow.

If you'd like to contribute to the specification, please clone and edit the
[Wiki][wiki].
